Our "Know My Health" pitch slide deck presents an innovative vision for personal healthcare management. This digital solution aims to revolutionize how patients in British Columbia understand and utilize their medical data through an AI-driven dashboard. By addressing the disconnect between existing fragmented medical data sources and patient comprehension, our platform proposes a more integrated and intuitive approach. With the use of simple color indicators, the ability to track health trends, and the incorporation of both existing and patient-generated health data, "Know My Health" empowers patients to become proactive participants in their healthcare journey. Our phased implementation strategy underscores the commitment to an equitable and secure healthcare experience, with the end-goal of enhancing patient engagement and improving overall health outcomes. The deck also delves into the challenges and next steps, underscoring the importance of stakeholder feedback and investment in realizing this transformative healthcare tool.
